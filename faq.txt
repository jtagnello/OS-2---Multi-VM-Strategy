There are the inevitable "this can't be done, for these reasons ..." thoughts.

List them here, along with possible solutions:

01. Too many OS's to keep straight:
  - this is true, we are using multiple OS's; a "host os", and one or more "guest os's" in vm's.
  - the ideal might be "start the system, be presented with a handful of windows" where each holds the OS you need.
  - every host os and every virtualization package has helpful or hindrance options to get to this ideal.
  - note the use of each helpful item, and possible solutions to the hindrance item, and we are there. 

02. This costs $$$:
  - ain't that the truth ... 
  - however, you can choose your path through this one, and it's your choice(s) that decide costs
  - $$$-1: ms os as host ($$$), Hyper-V virtualization is free within that host (pro, enterprise)
  - $$$-2: ms os as host ($$$), alternatively, use VirtualBox (could be home, pro, or enterprise)
  - FREE-1: linux as host (free), VirtualBox
  - host-os: ms ($$$), linux (usually free), potentially others ...
  - virtualization software:
    - VMware: Workstation Pro ($$$), PLayer (???)
    - Virtualbox: free, sort of ... guest additions piece has wierd licensing like Java
    - QEMU: free
    - multitudes of linux virtualization solutions: pretty much all free, some exceptions

03. where's my data, and who's keeping it safe:
  - 3-2-1 rule for backups always applies (or should)
  - your data lives on the host-os, if shared amongst all the os's (and that's an "ideal")
    - use the standard methods available to that os for backup, virus/ransomware protection, etc.
    - VirtualBox, for example, shares it to each os via "shared folders" method
  - it lives within the guest os, you'll be responsible for sharing it to other os's if desired
    - use any methods available in that os
    
QUOTES (gotta have these):

"The only constraints I have ever found are ... those in the mind.
Amazingly, they all come with on/off switches!" -- JT Agnello
  - remind me to search and see if someone beat me to this

"It DOES sound impossible, and those ARE problems that could block us ... 
Oh, wait. I'm doing this right now!" -- JT Agnello
  - can't count the number of times I've said this, in the business world
  - the trick is to identify a possible solution, test it, and then propose it as a solution
  - btw, they will still argue with you, so be ready
