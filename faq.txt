There are the inevitable "this can't be done, for these reasons ..." thoughts. List them here, along with possible solutions:


01. what is the quick way to do this?
  a.)  beefy hardware platform (i7 or better, 32gb ram or better, multiple ssd's)
  b.)  virtualization (VirtualBox)
  c.)  create vm's, install multiple os's (OS/2, Windows, Linux)(possibly even MAC OS)
  ... done! (read the guides in this repository for all the details)

02. Too many OS's to keep straight:
  - this is true, we are using multiple OS's; a "host os", and one or more "guest os's" in vm's.
  - we are making use of incredible technology (hardware, virtualization) that is now available to all of us.
  - the ideal might be "start the system, be presented with a handful of windows" where each holds the OS you need.
  - every host os and every virtualization package has helpful or hindrance options to get to this ideal.
  - note the use of each helpful item, and possible solutions to the hindrance item, and we are there. 

03. This costs $$$:
  - ain't that the truth ... 
  - however, you can choose your path through this one, and it's your choice(s) that decide costs
  - $$$-1: ms os as host ($$$), Hyper-V virtualization is free within that host (pro, enterprise)
  - $$$-2: ms os as host ($$$), alternatively, use VirtualBox (could be home, pro, or enterprise)
  - FREE-1: linux as host (free), VirtualBox
  - host-os: ms ($$$), linux (usually free), potentially others ...
  - virtualization software:
    - VMware: Workstation Pro ($$$), PLayer (???)
    - Virtualbox: free, sort of ... guest additions piece has wierd licensing like Java
    - QEMU: free
    - multitudes of linux virtualization solutions: pretty much all free, some exceptions

04. where's my data, and who's keeping it safe:
  - 3-2-1 rule for backups always applies (or should)
  - ideal: your data lives on the host-os, and is shared amongst all the os's in their vm's
    - use the standard methods available to that os for backup, virus/ransomware protection, etc.
    - VirtualBox, for example, shares it to each os via "shared folders" method
  - alternative: your data could live within each guest os
    - you'll be responsible for sharing it to other os's if desired
    - use any methods available in that os to protect the data (like you do today)

05. this sounds hard ... too hard to even start on:
  - any tool, when first introduced, takes some practice from each of us to figure out how best to use it
  - some even make it into your toolbox, and you become a pro at pulling out the right tool for the job
  - virtualization is just a tool to enable us to do more with our hardware
  - if you get this virtualization tool "into your toolbox", you WILL solve most, if not all, computing problems
  - these are problems where a "one os" strategy holds us back, and a "multi-vm" (multiple os) strategy frees us
  - if you don't think virtualization is "mainstream", consider that:
    - Microsoft now includes it in windows (Hyper-V)
    - many other vendors offer virtualization software (most are free), on every "host-os" platform
  - the hardware (our pc platforms) and the virtualization software has come together at the right time
  - our guides make it easy (easier)

06. Just stick with Microsoft Windows
  - somehere up to about Windows 7, this was a great strategy
    - the GUI was about right, the OS was stable, and there just wasn't much we couldn't do
    - updates were available on a schedule from MS, and you could choose to apply them or not
    - all your apps worked well, and you felt like you were in control ... life was good!
  - then something happened ... MS decided the OS wasn't really ours any longer
    - all successive Windows OS releases took away our ability to control the OS, and our own destiny
    - Windows 8.x, 10, and now 11, all make it worse, even as MS gives you more "features"
      - our control, and our own destiny, when using MS Windows, was now "GREYED OUT"
      - you could see it, it was right there, you just couldn't access it any longer
  - then something else happened ... business decided our information wasn't really ours any longer
    - clouds, subscriptions, privacy intrusions, harvesting of everything that we thought we owned
    - your control, your personal information, even your computing destiny, is being stripped away
  - luckily, the multi-vm strategy will get it all back for you ... the guides show you how!
  
07. Just stick with Linux (in any of its many flavors)
  - Linux is indeed a great OS ... thosands are working to make it better every day
    - many flavors to choose from (resulting in the need for much "testing", or kicking the tires on each flavor)
    - if you can live with its complexity, it will get you close to Windows-like
  - a better strategy is to put it in a vm, and kick the tires that way
    - when it's right for you, move it to "productivity vm" status
    - possibly, even make it the Host-OS!
  
08. What is OS/2 (ArcaOS), and why do I care?
  - OS/2 was pretty much the 1st 32-bit OS for the PC platform that ran all your dos/win apps
    - marketing-wise, many of us were sold on Windows, and you just lived with Windows' grief
    - same thing happens in car sales, all the time ... that's the power of sales tactics, marketing, etc.
  - by the time OS/2 hit the 4.x series (OS/2 Warp), it was perfect, with an object-oriented desktop environment
    - it ran multiple 16-bit dos or win apps, and usually better than windows could
    - it ran multiple 32-bit OS/2 apps ... these are powerful
    - everything was an object ... drag it to another object, and both objects now make things happen for you
  - the windows marketing juggernaut rolled on ...
    - right over our technical needs for something better than windows
    - OS/2 languished in the background, always there, but not mainstream any longer
    - IBM discontinued sales; eComStation took over sales; now ArcaOS has the reins
  - ArcaOS is doing it right ...
    - new device drivers for OS/2, on modern hardware ... many other improvements
    - but wait, there's still my favorite app on Windows, and it isn't available for OS/2 (or Linux, or ...)
  - don't wait any longer ... the Multi-VM strategy solves all these problems
    - run multiple OS's in multiple VM's, and get the best of all, right now
    - ArcaOS (in a multi-vm strategy) makes productivity vm status!
    - Windows gives you grief ... put it in a VM, and contain it, while still getting at the apps on Windows
    - Linux is up and coming ... put it in a VM and test (all of them), and get it to productivity status
 
 09. Multi-VM is starting to sound pretty cool ... what else can I do with it?
   - once the architecture is in place for you (hardware, virtualization), there's not much limiting you in VM's
     - if one productivity vm is good for you, then two, or three, could possibly be better for you!
     - one APP per VM, contained/isolated, might be better than all your eggs (apps) in one basket (Windows)
     - how about RETRO vm's, where you run an old os that has a certain game you can't live without?
   - how about the next great thing to come?
     - being multi-vm means you can experience new things alongside your productivity VM's
     - the productive VM's run stable; the new thing VM can crash and it won't take down your other VM's



QUOTES (gotta have these):

"The only constraints I have ever found are ... those in the mind.
Amazingly, they all come with on/off switches!" -- JT Agnello
  - remind me to search and see if someone beat me to this

"It DOES sound impossible, and those ARE problems that could block us ... 
Oh, wait. I'm doing this right now!" -- JT Agnello
  - can't count the number of times I've said this, in the business world
  - the trick is to identify a possible solution, test it, and then propose it as a solution
  - btw, many will still argue with you, so be ready
