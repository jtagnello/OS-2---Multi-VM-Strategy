What are we building here? We need a hardware platform that:
  - fully supports the Multi-VM strategy (or at the very least, doesn't get in the way)
  - once set up, is hardly ever touched
  - anything happening at this level is as automated as possible (set it and forget it)

A quick "building construction" analogy:
  - the host os is the "foundation" upon which the entire virtualization stategy is built
    - do it right, and you won't have problems that bring down some of the rooms, or possibly all of the house
  - virtualization sofware is like the electrical wiring (a subsystem) of this home
    - could be simple and clean wiring, and you just flip a switch for it to work (Workstation Pro, Virtualbox)
    - could be messy/complex wiring (Hyper-V), with pieces of it in every other system of your house (but it also works)
  - vm's are the "room(s)" that you use
    - some rooms you live in most hours of the day (productivity vm's)
    - some you work in for just an hour or so (occasional use, but still useful VM)
    - and some are like the attic/basement that you visit once or twice per year (kick the tires VM).

So, here's (multiple paths to get to) a good foundation:

01. A hardware platform (for the home market) with these *minimum* characteristics:
  - Intel i7 multi-core cpu (or AMD equivalent) or better
  - minimum 32gb of ram (or better, 64GB)
  - one or more SSD's (or NVMe's)
  - will have device driver support for (your choice of) a Host-OS
  - it could be a purchased desktop (DT) or laptop (LT)
  - easy these days to build yourself (DIY)
  - high-end graphics (gaming-class) card not necessary; the built-in graphics on most any purchased computer is fine
    if diy, the graphics built-in to the MOBO is fine
    special considerations if you DO want a high-end graphics (gaming-class) card, and want to share to all VM's
  01a. Intel platforms:
    - possibilities:
      - buy a dt/lt to the above specs ... shop around on amazon, best buy, or your local resources
      - buy a NUC (intel NUC, complete small form-factor), add 16GB ram & ssd ... ready for host-os
      - diy: Intel/other i7 motherboard w/ 4 slots for ram, i7 cpu, 4x8gb(or 16gb) dimms, one or more ssd's
        add a case, power supply, keyboard/monitor ... assemble ... ready for host-os
        the more modern the MOBO, the more capabilities it will have (more ram, more ssd slot support, etc.)
      - websites to help you build (google search for latest/current results, dozens of options)
        https://www.newegg.com/insider/building-a-gaming-pc-for-the-first-time-dont-panic-this-guide-can-help-you-out/
        note that these sites, while helpful in building a pc, assume you want a business-class pc, not a VM-capable pc
      - our own build process for a VM-capable DIY pc will be forth-coming
      - you can always specify your requirements, and have a custom pc built for you
  01b. AMD platform
  01c. ... others (that folks have done)?
  
02. planning for uses on that platform (helps you decide what platform elements to get)
  - will run a host-os (not the same as your "primary" os)
    - plan for your virtualization layer (most likely a Type-2, but could be otherwise)
    - guest additions (the tools added to each vm to make use of virtualized components of your platform)
  - will hold "local" data:
    - local data storage (shared out to all the vm's on the host-os)
    - local NAS (holds big stuff, backups, etc. ... whatever you can think of)
  - services:
    - lan
    - local NAS (synology, other)
    - internet (your home router, internet connection)
  - ensure everything:
    - "supports" virtualization (Intel/AMD virtualization extensions in the cpu) as best as possible
    - can be "virtualized" and presented to the vm's (i.e., ethernet card can be virtualized thru "guest additions")

More to come ...

Feel free to add in or rework, as you see fit, if you have complementary solutions.
