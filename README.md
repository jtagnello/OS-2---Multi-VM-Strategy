# OS-2---Multi-VM-Strategy
Run OS/2 (and other OS's) on modern hardware, with a modern type-2 virtualization layer, and get the best of all worlds! Here's how ...

At a high level, this strategy applies to all OS's ... build up your modern hardware environment (desktop/laptop, i7, 32gb ram, ssd's), slap on a type-2 virtualization layer like VirtualBox, and add os's that meet your productivity needs, like:

- ArcaOS (the modern OS/2) or OS/2 Warp
- Windows (any flavor)
- Linux (any flavor)


These are called "productivity vm's", because rarely does one OS meet all your needs. You may need two or more to cover all the requirements you might have. You may also have "testing vm's", where you are "kicking the tires" on an OS (testing it) to see if it makes it into your "productivity" class of vm's; most flavors of linux could be considered in the testing class, as there are multitudes of these OS's to test and keep track of. What else might make the cut into your list of vm's? How about:

- Retro (any ancient OS or oddity that can run in a virtualized environment)

"Retro" vm's are where you kick the tires (again) on something old, to relive the glory days or perhaps even move it (somehow) into the "productivity" class of vm's. For example, any old DOS-based game that is still fun for you to play.

Here's my initial article, upon which to start this repository going:

It is anticipated that we'll produce quickstart guides (or pointers to the same) for anyone to use to build up their own Multi-VM-Strategy! I'll curate it, but please feel free to add materials ... if known-copyright free, add the item. If unknown copyright status, just add pointers and descriptions.
